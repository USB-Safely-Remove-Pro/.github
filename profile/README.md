## What is USB Safely Remove?

**USB Safely Remove** is a professional and user-friendly software utility designed to safely eject USB devices, external hard drives, memory cards, and other removable media from Windows computers. Unlike the standard Windows "Safely Remove Hardware" feature, USB Safely Remove offers advanced functionality, better device visibility, and greater control over connected devices.

With USB Safely Remove, users can:
- Avoid data loss and device corruption.
- Manage hidden and non-removable devices.
- Customize device icons and names.
- Enjoy hotkey support for quick ejection.

It is an essential tool for IT professionals, office workers, and everyday users who frequently use external storage devices. The software supports all versions of Windows, including Windows 10 and Windows 11, and is available both as a free and paid version with extended features.
